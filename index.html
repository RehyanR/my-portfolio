      <p>Hi my name is Rehyan. Don't worry it's a lot easier to pronounce than it looks. Ree-Anne. Pleasure to have you on my page.
        <br>
        I am a 31 year old aspiring front-end web developer on a journey fueled by my excitement and commitment for continuous learning. With a diploma in media studies, a background in customer service, team leadership and working independently to ensure targets are always met, I'm now immersing myself in a 16-week front-end web development bootcamp to turn my passion into a profession.
        <br>
        I am captivated by the ever-evolving world of web development, where creativity meets technology. The ability to bring ideas to life through coding is what drives my enthusiasm. I am excited about the prospect of combining my diverse skill set with my newfound coding skills to create innovative and impactful web solutions.
        <br>
        Throughout the bootcamp I am acquiring hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is not just to learn the technical skills but to apply them creatively to design user-friendly and visually appealing websites for everyones needs.
        <br>
        In addition to my formal education, I am an avid self-learner, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge. I am committed to staying at the forefront of web development trends and continuously refining my skills.
        <br>
        I am eager to connect with fellow developers, mentors, and potential collaborators. Whether you have advice to share, a project to collaborate on, or just want to chat about web development, feel free to reach out!
        <br>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the exciting journey ahead in the world of front-end web development!
