My Front-End Web Development Portfolio

Description
This portolio showcasing the work I have completed so far in my front-end web development journey. This is my first attempt and I came across some obstacles. There are a lot of things Iâ€™m still learning so research was key. I spent a lot of time on google, w3chools and YouTube to make sure I had a good understanding of what I was doing during each step. Making sure to push changes regularly to my GitHub repo.
